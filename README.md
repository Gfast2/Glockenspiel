# Glockenspiel
A interactive design for the Carillon which build in the german city Halle (Saale)'s "Roter Turn" (Red Tower).

In City Halle (Saale), where I studied and lived for year, there is a high tower in the middle of the market square. A instrument that has more than 50 tons is build in it. Even the most citizen living in Halle don't know much about this world second biggest Carillon ("Glockenspiel" in German). 

In my fist master semester I decided to build a simulator for this Master Piece, In order to let it get more attention by people. The simulator itself is builded with Unity3D. The "Roter Turm" ("Red Tower" in English) is modeled with Rhino3D. The Sound Data is sourced from internet but not recorded directly from this carillon. More detail about this instrument can be found in Wikipedia
